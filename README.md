# Wildfire-Detection-using-NDVI-conversion

In this project, the dataset was picked up from kaggle which contained a series of wildfire and no wildfire images. By using NDVI conversion the accuracy of detecting a wildfire intuitively increases, ie. since you remove the reds from the image. Thus a CNN classifier was created which used binary cross entropy and other loss functions to classify the images, ie. if there was a wildifire or not.
